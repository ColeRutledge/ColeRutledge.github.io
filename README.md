## Hello, world! Welcome to my GitHub Pages site!

## About Me

I am a former NYC technical recruiter turned Software Engineer.  I've spent the last decade working with brilliant engineers as a recruiter in helping to fill roles with numerous tech startups in and around the Manhattan area.  I'm a firm believer that software and technology **are** going to solve many of the world's problems, but until recently, I haven't had the skills to be able to contribute. I look forward to a lifetime of continued education in this field and aim to keep this profile updated with information about my endeavors.  Follow at your own risk.
